## Frontend for HackerNews

This is a project made to learn a bit about React.

Check it out on github pages [HackerNews React](https://marias210.github.io/skunkworks/).

### Installation

In the project directory, install npm packages with:

#### `npm install`

Then, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Development

After you've made your modifications run:

#### `npm run-script build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run deploy`

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

That's it!
